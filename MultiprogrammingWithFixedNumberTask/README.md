# Multiprogramming with Fixed Number of Task
## MFT is one of the old memory management techniques in which the memory is partitioned into fixed size partitions and each job is assigned to a partition. The memory assigned to a partition does not change. Memory allocation is in contiguous form.
## MFT suffers with the problem of internal fragmentation
## Merit of MFT
-The algorithm to implement mft is easy
- Processing of Fixed Partitioning require lesser excess and indirect computational power. 
## The Drawbacks of MFT are :
- Degree of multiprogramming is not flexible. This is because the number of blocks is fixed resulting in memory wastage due to fragmentation.
