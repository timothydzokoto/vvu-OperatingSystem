# FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm

FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) is the easiest disk scheduling algorithm among all the scheduling algorithms. In the FCFS disk scheduling algorithm, each input/output request is served in the order in which the requests arrive. In this algorithm, starvation does not occur because FCFS address each request.

## Advantages of FCFS Disk scheduling Algorithm
The advantages of FCFS disk scheduling algorithm are:

- In FCFS disk scheduling, there is no indefinite delay.
- There is no starvation in FCFS disk scheduling because each request gets a fair chance.

## Disadvantages of FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm
The disadvantages of FCFS disk scheduling algorithm are:

- FCFS scheduling is not offered as the best service.
- In FCFS, scheduling disk time is not optimized.
