# First Fit
In the first fit approach is to allocate the first free partition or hole large enough which can accommodate the process. It finishes after finding the first suitable free partition.

## Advantage
Fastest algorithm because it searches as little as possible.

## Disadvantage
The remaining unused memory areas left after allocation become waste if it is too smaller. Thus request for larger memory requirement cannot be accomplished.
