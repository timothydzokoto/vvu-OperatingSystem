# Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm 
Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm is a modified version of SCAN disk scheduling algorithm that deals with the inefficiency of SCAN algorithm by servicing the requests more uniformly. Like SCAN (Elevator Algorithm) C-SCAN moves the head from one end servicing all the requests to the other end. However, as soon as the head reaches the other end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk without servicing any requests on the return trip and starts servicing again once reaches the beginning. This is also known as the “Circular Elevator Algorithm” as it essentially treats the cylinders as a circular list that wraps around from the final cylinder to the first one.
